Description: EUtils is a client library for the Entrez databases at NCBI.
        
        NCBI provides the EUtils web service so that software can query Entrez
        directly, rather than going through the web interface and dealing with
        the hassles of web scraping.  For more information see

        This package provides two levels of interface.  The lowest one makes a
        programmatic interface to construct the query URL and make the
        request.  The higher level ones support history tracking and parsing
        of query results.  These greatly simplify working with the EUtils
        server.
